/*  task is to find the count of times sai breaks her record for the highest and lowest scores throughout the season. 
We need to keep track of the highest and lowest scores as we iterate through the scores array and update the counts accordingly.

    int low = scores[0];
    int high = scores[0];
    int c1 = 0, c2 = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i < scores_count; i++) {
        if (scores[i] > high) {
            c1++;
            high = scores[i];
        } else if (scores[i] < low) {
            c2++;
            low = scores[i];

    int* rc = (int*)malloc(2 * sizeof(int));
    rc[0] = c1; // Count for highest score was broken
    rc[1] = c2; // Count for lowest score was broken
